  "deep_meaning": "Temperance represents balance, moderation, and harmony. An angel pours water between two cups, symbolizing the alchemical mixing of opposites to create something new. This card teaches the middle way - avoiding extremes and finding equilibrium in all things. Temperance is about patience, purpose, and the gradual blending of elements to achieve the perfect mix. It speaks to healing through balance and the importance of timing. True alchemy happens when we learn to moderate our energies and work with natural flows rather than against them.",
