  "deep_meaning": "The Hanged Man represents surrender, new perspectives, and enlightenment through sacrifice. Hanging upside down from a tree, he appears calm and even serene, suggesting voluntary suspension and a different way of seeing the world. This card teaches that sometimes we must let go of control and allow events to unfold. The sacrifice here is not suffering but rather releasing old patterns to gain wisdom. By suspending action and accepting a period of waiting, we often gain insights that would never come through force or struggle.",
