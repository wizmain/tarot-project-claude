Lightning strikes a tower built on faulty foundations, sending people falling from its heights. This card speaks to those moments when everything we thought was solid comes crashing down. While frightening, The Tower is ultimately liberating - it destroys only what was built on lies, illusions, or shaky ground. The lightning is divine intervention, a wake-up call that, though painful, clears the way for rebuilding on truth and solid foundations.",
