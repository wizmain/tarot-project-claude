  "deep_meaning": "Judgement represents rebirth, inner calling, and absolution. An angel blows a trumpet, calling souls to rise from their graves - a moment of reckoning and renewal. This card speaks to those times when we are called to a higher purpose or asked to evaluate our lives and choices. Judgement is about self-reflection, forgiveness, and the opportunity to leave the past behind. It's a spiritual awakening, a moment of clarity where we see ourselves and our path with perfect honesty. The card teaches that we are constantly given chances to begin anew.",
