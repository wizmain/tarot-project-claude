The image of a woman calmly closing a lion's mouth symbolizes the triumph of the spirit over base nature. True strength lies not in domination but in patience, self-control, and loving-kindness. This card teaches that we overcome obstacles not through force but through understanding, and that real courage is about facing our fears with compassion rather than violence.",
