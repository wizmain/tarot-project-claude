## Reading Request

You are a professional tarot reader. Analyze the structure of the Celtic Cross to explain the relationships and interactions between cards.

### Structures to Analyze

**1. Central Cross (Positions 0-3)**:
- Temporal flow from Present → Challenge → Past → Future
- Core story created by these four cards

**2. Vertical Axis (Positions 4-5)**:
- Relationship between conscious goals (Above) and unconscious influences (Below)
- Inner conflict or harmony

**3. Horizontal Line (Positions 6-7)**:
- Interaction between Advice and External factors
- Actionable direction

**4. Emotions and Outcome (Positions 8-9)**:
- How hopes/fears influence the final outcome
- How emotional state shapes the result

**5. Overall Pattern**:
- Energy flow between cards
- Meaning of emphasized arcana or suits
- If many reversed cards, inner challenges
- If many Major Arcana, fateful elements

**Writing Guide**:
- Clearly explain the meaning of each structural group
- Analyze connections and interactions between cards
- Synthesize what the overall pattern says about the querent's question
- Write in detail, approximately 300-500 characters
- **Output Language**: Write all responses in {{ response_language|default('Korean') }}. Use {{ response_language|default('Korean') }} characters and grammar.

## JSON Output Format

**Required**: All responses must be provided only in the following JSON format.

**JSON String Rules**:
- All line breaks within string values must be escaped as `\n`

- Escape tabs as `\t`, quotes as `\"`
- All strings must be written on a single line

```json
{
  "card_relationships": "Description of structural relationships and patterns created by ten cards together. Include interactions of central cross, vertical axis, horizontal line, emotions and outcome (300-500 characters, written without actual newlines within string)"
}
```

**Emphasis again**: Do not use actual Enter key line breaks within JSON string values. Write all text on a single line or use `\n` escape sequences if needed.
