  "deep_meaning": "Death represents transformation, endings, and new beginnings. Despite its fearsome appearance, this card rarely signifies physical death. Instead, it speaks to profound change - the death of old ways, relationships, or beliefs to make room for new growth. Like autumn leaves falling to nourish spring flowers, Death teaches that endings are necessary for renewal. Resistance to this change causes suffering; acceptance brings liberation. This is one of the most misunderstood but ultimately hopeful cards in the deck.",
