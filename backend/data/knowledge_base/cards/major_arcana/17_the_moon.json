This card speaks to the realm of dreams, fears, and hidden truths. The path between two towers winds into the distance, uncertain and mysterious. The Moon teaches us to trust our intuition while remaining aware that our perceptions may be clouded by fear or projection. It asks us to explore our inner landscape and face what lurks in our unconscious.",
