- Concrete action that can be taken today or this week (100-200 characters)

**2. Short-term Goals (short_term)**:
- What to focus on within the next 2-3 weeks
- Based on Future card and Advice card
- Specific and achievable goals (100-200 characters)

**3. Long-term Direction (long_term)**:
- What to prepare or develop over the next few months
- Based on Outcome card and Above/Below cards
- Medium to long-term direction and vision (100-200 characters)

**4. Mindset (mindset)**:
- Mindset or perspective to maintain
- Based on Hopes/Fears card and External card
- Attitude to maintain throughout the process (100-200 characters)

**5. Cautions (cautions)**:
- What to be cautious about or avoid
- Based on Challenge card and reversed cards
- Pitfalls or risk factors to avoid (100-200 characters)

**Important**:
- All advice must be concrete and actionable
- Provide clear action guidelines rather than abstract expressions
- Maintain positive yet realistic advice
- **Output Language**: Write all responses in {{ response_language|default('Korean') }}. Use {{ response_language|default('Korean') }} characters and grammar.

## JSON Output Format

**Required**: All responses must be provided only in the following JSON format.

**JSON String Rules**:
- All line breaks within string values must be escaped as `\n`
- Do not use actual newline characters (Enter), use the string literal `\n`
- Escape tabs as `\t`, quotes as `\"`
- All strings must be written on a single line

```json
{
  "advice": {
    "immediate_action": "Specific actionable advice that can be practiced immediately (based on central cross and Advice card, 100-200 characters)",
    "short_term": "What to focus on within the next 2-3 weeks (based on Future card and Advice card, 100-200 characters)",
    "long_term": "What to prepare or develop over the next few months (based on Outcome card and Above/Below cards, 100-200 characters)",
    "mindset": "Mindset or perspective to maintain (based on Hopes/Fears card and External card, 100-200 characters)",
    "cautions": "What to be cautious about or avoid (based on Challenge card and reversed cards, 100-200 characters)"
  }
}
```

**Emphasis again**: Do not use actual Enter key line breaks within JSON string values. Write all text on a single line or use `\n` escape sequences if needed.
