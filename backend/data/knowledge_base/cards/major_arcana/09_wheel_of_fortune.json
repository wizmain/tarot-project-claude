  "deep_meaning": "The Wheel of Fortune represents cycles, destiny, and turning points. Life moves in cycles of good and bad fortune, and this card reminds us that change is the only constant. What goes up must come down, and what falls will rise again. The wheel teaches acceptance of life's natural rhythms and the understanding that we are part of something greater than ourselves. It speaks to karma, fate, and the interconnectedness of all things. When this card appears, significant change is afoot - embrace it rather than resist it.",
