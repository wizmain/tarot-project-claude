This card teaches that we are often prisoners of our own making, bound by unhealthy attachments, addictions, or limiting beliefs. The Devil is not an external force but our own shadow - the parts of ourselves we deny or repress. Freedom comes from acknowledging these aspects and recognizing that we have the power to release ourselves from self-imposed limitations.",
