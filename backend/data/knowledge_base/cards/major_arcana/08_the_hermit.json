  "deep_meaning": "The Hermit represents introspection, solitude, and inner wisdom. Standing alone on a mountaintop with only a lantern to light the way, he symbolizes the journey inward to find truth. This is a time for withdrawal from the external world to focus on spiritual understanding and self-discovery. The Hermit teaches that sometimes we must step back from the noise of daily life to hear our inner voice. His light is both a beacon for others and illumination for his own path, suggesting that wisdom gained in solitude can eventually guide others.",
